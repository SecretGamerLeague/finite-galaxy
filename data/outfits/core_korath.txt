  description "In response to occasional raids by the robotic war machines left behind after their recent conflict, the Kor Efret have developed this minimal, spartan command centre that can be installed in a captured robotic ship to allow a pilot to override the AI and interface with the ship's controls. The command centre only provides a single bunk for the captain, so more may be necessary if the ship has turrets or other systems that require crew."

  description "This is a miniaturized communication device, which can be connected to all the major systems of a Kor Sestor automaton, apparently as a way of controlling them remotely. The communications are encrypted and authenticated in a way that would make it nearly impossible to spoof the control signals."
