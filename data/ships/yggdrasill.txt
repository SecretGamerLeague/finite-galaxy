  description "This Arrow has had numerous modifications to its hull and internal systems to make more room for outfits – mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, outfit space, and a turret mount nearly push this ship into the Corvette category, and definitely make it one of the heaviest Interceptors you're likely to find."

Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Bounder remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

  description "The Whale is a formidable warship, with powerful shields, a lot of hull armour, and more firepower than any ship sold in human space, allowing it to deal out and absorb a significant amount of damage. A single Whale can hold its own against a small fleet of lesser vessels. Its main drawback is its costs: deploying a few smaller ships is practically always more effective."
