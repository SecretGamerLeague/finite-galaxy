  description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well armoured and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."

  description "The Tarazed Falcon is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a planetary militia's patrol squadron. Falcons are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, but are capable of mounting much more weapons, including a turret. They are also, of course, a favourite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."
  description "The Falcon is the most affordable ships designed by Tarazed: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for escorting freighters or for bounty hunting. As with many of Tarazed's designs, the hull is mostly composite fibre rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement."

  description "After the Blackbird gained surprising popularity as an agile light warship despite its original design as a transport, Tarazed decided to produce a new design specifically intended as a warship. The Osprey was the result. Although it is considered overpriced by most savvy pilots, it is nevertheless a perennial favourite among those who have the extra cash to spend on it."

  description "A former owner of this ship apparently didn't like the lithe Raven, and has added so much more weapons, shield, and outfit capacity to it that you only recognize it by the wingtips. Besides adding a turret, this ship has enormous gun ports, making you wonder how much more deadly you could make a Light Warship."
