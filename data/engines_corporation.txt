  description `The Corporation took the opportunity to integrate their smallest thruster models to create a more compact steering and thrusting engine. The result is not very useful on anything but a fighter, and is only "adequate" in that role. Still, if engine space is at a premium, this is the smallest set of engines that will still get you there (eventually).`

  description "The X2700 ion thruster is intended mostly for use in small, single-person or two-person ships, as well as in fighters. It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."
