  description "Coalition engineers prefer to focus on perfecting a few versatile designs rather than producing a wide range of them. This thruster is quite efficient, but large ships will need several of them stacked together to produce sufficient thrust."

  description "Despite its high efficiency, this module is not sufficient for any but the tiniest of ships. Instead, the modules are designed with the expectation that ships may use two or three of them in tandem."

  description "By focusing on small, modular engines rather than the massive capital ship drives that most other species develop, the Coalition loses some of the potential efficiency for very large ships, but gains a considerable amount of flexibility."
